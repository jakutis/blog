Gunter Dueck in his talk [The World after Cloud Computing & Big Data](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/cloud-computing-big-data) says:
> You should have at least T shape. This is the next preaching. The theory is 10 years old and now it becomes really serious.
> That's the content of my talk. It means technology people are deep, they know everything but only ten meters diameter on the world.
> Managers are know everything but nothing. They've heard everything.

Barbara Sher in her book [I Could Do Anything If I Only Knew What It Was](http://www.barbarasher.com/icoulddo.htm) writes:
> The first step is to understand who you really are—that is, why you want so many things. Once you know that, I’ll show you some further steps you can take to get yourself a life that suits you.
> There are two big reasons you might be wanting too many things and feeling all over the map about it.
> Reason No. 1: You’re a born scanner—you’re a person who delights in the astonishing, unending variety around us—but you don’t realize that being a scanner is a very respectable profession. You don’t yet know that scanning is a talent, the key to a very good life.
> Reason No. 2: You’re a born diver—you’re like a deep-sea diver; your curiosity makes you want to go deeper and deeper into your subject until you dedicate your entire life to it—but you appear to be a scanner at this moment because something’s blocking you from diving. In spite of how your life looks now, you are not really a scanner. You are the kind of person who loves to delve deeply into a subject. You need to figure out what’s stopping you from diving.

On this picture from the talk by Dueck wide are the managers and deep are the technology people.

Sher calls wide people scanners and deep people divers.

<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Scanners want to taste everything. They love to learn about the structure of a flower, and they love to learn about the theory of music. And the adventures of travel. And the tangle of politics. To scanners, the universe is a treasure house full of a million works of art, and life is hardly long enough to see them all.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Robert Frost defined divers and scanners very neatly when he said “A scholar is someone who sticks to something. A poet is someone who uses whatever sticks to him.”</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Because our culture values the diver’s specialization and determination, we too often think of scanners as people who simply won’t get down to work.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">This is a foolish cultural oversight.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">If you’re a scanner, <em style="font-style: italic">you have extraordinarily special and valuable skills</em>. You love what is new, and you don’t suffer from fear and indecisiveness. You’re highly adaptable to new cultures; you’re so flexible you can turn on a dime. You’re a lightning-fast learner, curious about anything you don’t already understand; you like and respect all kinds of thinking. Although you may be unwilling to dedicate yourself to one path, you don’t lack discipline or have a low IQ. On the contrary, you’re dedicated to <a id="calibre_link-148"></a>learning all that you can, and you’re intelligent enough to delight in all that you learn.</p>

<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">In many cases the only problem for scanners is finding the kind of work that will allow them to use their talent for scanning. Career aptitude tests tend to miss scanners. Take Jack, for instance.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Jack went to the most respected career testing service he could find. His tests showed he was equally skilled in music, nature, mathematics, science, and literature. As a matter of fact, there was <em style="font-style: italic">no</em> subject for which he showed no aptitude!</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">The career counselors who tested him told Jack there was no way around it, he’d have to make a choice. “You can be a musician, a science teacher, a mathematician, or an editor in a publishing house. Which one do you want?”</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Jack knew he wouldn’t be happy at any of them: “I’ve never gotten past Anything 101. In college, when I would take second and third courses in some discipline, like pre-med, or French literature, I’d feel like I was on a detour, off my path. What I really loved was the <em style="font-style: italic">overview</em>, the sense of where philosophy belongs in a person’s life, or history belongs, or physics, for that matter. Once I’d get something located, I wanted to look at something else.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">“My advisors didn’t know what to do with me. They called me a perennial student. But I couldn’t make a choice. I racked up so many credits they <em style="font-style: italic">had to</em> graduate me after a while. And there I was, no wiser than before about what I was supposed to be when I grew up.”</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Jack wandered for a few years, until he accidentally stumbled into a writing assignment for a newsletter to be handed out at a convention for inventors. He really enjoyed interviewing all the different inventors for this article, so he went looking for other writing assignments.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em"><a id="calibre_link-149"></a>That was twenty years ago. Today Jack is a successful free-lance writer, and he loves his life. He just got back from touring the Far East with an American opera company, and this fall he’ll be on Mont Blanc in France with a group of French mountain climbers to write about their climb.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Jack is&mdash;and you might be&mdash;a popularizer. He can learn about biology, but what he likes to do with his knowledge of biology is translate it to the world&mdash;he’s a communicator. He’s a teacher.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">It can take time and ingenuity to find a scanner’s niche, work that accommodates all of a scanner’s many interests. But the results are worth it.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Scanners <em style="font-style: italic">are</em> poets&mdash;and librarians, documentary filmmakers, explorers, brilliant salespeople, good managers, naturally gifted teachers.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">We’re trained to believe that we only get one choice in our lives. But to scanners, one choice sounds like someone’s saying, “You can have a coloring book <em style="font-style: italic">or</em> you can have crayons, but you can’t have both,” and they’re onto something. Scanners know that life is not stingy. If anything, life is too generous. The choices are dizzying. But there’s a way to manage the riches.</p>
<h3 style="display: block; font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 2em; text-align: center"><strong style="font-weight: bold"><em style="font-style: italic">Having It All: Sequentially</em></strong></h3>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">One of the things that drive scanners to distraction is that they’re in a terrific hurry. But, although you should not waste any more time by being stuck, you should never hurry, because 1) there’s more time than you think, 2) hurry is inefficient, and 3) part of your problem is caused by what I call time sickness. Time sickness is a form of hysteria that makes you believe you must fill every waking hour going after what you want, that everything must be done at once because time is about to end. You have no sense of the future, the leisurely course that time actually takes in most of our lives. Writing lists only makes your problem worse, and calendars have to be used with great care or they’ll become packed with enough projects for a dozen people.</p>

A diver knows that if he delves deeper into knowledge of a flower, it will transform itself into biology, chemistry, into molecules, into atoms.

<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Lydia worked as a street vendor and made good money, but she couldn’t see street vending as her lifetime career. “I just happened into it, and I started making good money. But I can’t figure out what to do next.”</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">We did some questioning for a little while and then she said, “I almost signed up for a business course that teaches you to make a good salary working at home on your computer. But what if it isn’t what I want?”</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">“Do you like working on your computer?”</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">“I love it,” she said. “I love spreadsheets. I love doing the number crunching everyone else hates. But I can’t sit home and do spreadsheets for myself. And I don’t want to do temp work. It’s corporate and it doesn’t make enough money.”</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">“Why couldn’t you run a business doing free-lance work for corporations, rush jobs they’re understaffed for?”</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Lydia started to look interested, so I continued.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">“You could start a spreadsheet business and still keep your vending job. Just try it out. Sounds like a no-risk way to try to be a computer entrepreneur.”</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Lydia was interested. She immediately thought up a sales slogan for her business: “Why tie up your executives for days crunching numbers, when I can do it for you overnight!”</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">“I could contact hotels and provide a spreadsheet service for traveling executives.

But I didn’t want to mention it right away. There was the outside chance that Lydia <em style="font-style: italic">should</em> be looking into a career as a vet instead of starting the home business, and it would do no harm to take her at her word.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">“Have you ever looked into being a vet?”</p>

<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">“For instance?”</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">“I don’t know,” she said. “I really don’t like medicine much.”</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">I said, “You’re going to have to find a touchstone for your love of animals.

<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Lydia fidgeted on the couch. “Not really. Boy, I feel very strange. Very blank, suddenly.”</p>

<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">A commitment may feel to you like some kind of trap, but it isn’t a trap.

<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">You should know that most people enjoy making commitments.

<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">People who fear commitment don’t get results.

<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Sometimes people who are unusually bright can’t get past the enthusiastic, creative period where they shine and into a period where they have to slow down and learn the material. They <em style="font-style: italic">want</em> to follow through but they never learned how to learn. So they become frustrated with the difficulties. Sooner or later they drop out and go looking for the high of beginning a new project. They hope <em style="font-style: italic">this</em> time they’ll be able to follow through, but then they crash again.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">They don’t understand what slower children learned very well&mdash;<em style="font-style: italic">if you stick with learning there’s a big payoff at the end</em>. People who don’t stick with exercising or a sport are the same way. They don’t see the point in staying with anything that doesn’t pay off immediately. They never did it, and they’re not used to it, and they don’t believe it works.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Sometimes these people were bewildered by too much unwarranted praise when they were children. The overpraised child never learns how to work hard at something until he has accomplished his goal. He’s never tested his stamina or developed self-discipline, and therefore he lacks self-confidence.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Carol was a great beginner in college, but when the going got the least bit tough, she gave up. “I secretly thought I was stupid, and I’d get found out. So I’d come in, dazzle everybody, then disappear before they could find me out,” she said.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Carol’s parents had tried to give her everything and cushion every step, but when she went to college, nobody acted like her parents. In college, you passed your exams or you were history. This depressed Carol; it seemed cold and judgmental. She eventually dropped out and came home, her self-confidence shattered. She had no tolerance for even a small amount of frustration.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em"><em style="font-style: italic">But think about the uses of frustration</em>.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Frustration is supposed to create action, not make you give up. We all need to learn how to handle frustrations so we can stick <a id="calibre_link-158"></a>with things until we have some capability; that’s how to develop self-confidence.</p>

Instead of facing a bad feeling, I’ll go do something,” a woman in one of my workshops said. In other words, whenever she was depressed, she could get a high from starting something new. That high&mdash;like highs from drugs or auto racing&mdash;is short-lived. The second a new activity becomes “old,” the high evaporates for you and your old feeling seeps into the new activity. When you need a “high” you’re probably avoiding a “low.” Check yourself out to see if you’re fighting chronic heavyheartedness (read <a href="#calibre_link-27" style="text-decoration: none">Chapter 12</a>: “Nothing Ever Interests Me”).</p>

Nine times out of ten, completing a project will make you feel much better&mdash;even when it feels meaningless. But it’s sure to kick up some of the worst discomfort you’ve ever felt. More than most people, you need to experience pushing right through your discomfort and coming out the other side. It can be a revelation.</p>

<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">There are a number of possible answers to that question, and all of them point to childhood. You may be the child of controlling or manipulative parents or siblings, and your survival depended on learning how to avoid entrapment. Or you may have experienced some kind of abuse or abandonment in your early years, and you’ve promised yourself to stay alert and watchful so it doesn’t happen again. Then, every time you allow yourself to become immersed in something, you wake with a start, as though you had dozed off on guard duty. Whatever your particular problem, you’re afraid something bad will happen if you delve deeply into what you really love.</p>

<li style="display: list-item"><p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify">Patience is the key here. Learners know that learning can be slow, but they understand that there is always a payoff. You’ve never experienced that payoff because you were always faster than anyone at the start of any project&mdash;and gave up the minute you got lost. To break out of that pattern you must learn to cherish something you have always dreaded: the ignorance that a newcomer inevitably feels. Zen calls it “Beginner’s Mind,” and honors its nobility.</p></li>

Call it “Lost and Found for Dreams.” Now, every time you want to jump prematurely into a new project, write on separate slips of paper all the pursuits you fear you’ll never get around to if you make a commitment to one goal. See if you can come up with lots of projects, small and big, that you want to do someday.</p>

Always feeling like amateurs, but sensing <a id="calibre_link-162"></a>their considerable talent, these people are caught in a nightmare of self-evaluation: Am I a genius or am I a fool? That seesaw thinking is a painful mistake people make when they haven’t worked enough. An inexperienced actor might say, “I am probably the greatest actor who ever lived. I can just feel the talent in me.” And the next moment he thinks, “I’m the biggest loser who ever lived; I can’t act at all.”</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Well, <em style="font-style: italic">he’s neither</em>.

<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">The instructions are simple: Spend one half hour each day doing <em style="font-style: italic">something</em> until you get good at it. It’s not important what you do: make an omelet, or do sit-ups until your tummy is flat, or learn to juggle. <em style="font-style: italic">But do it every day and try to get it right</em>. Keep doing the same thing over and over until you begin to notice results.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">You need to let this information seep into you: <em style="font-style: italic">When you stick</em> <a id="calibre_link-163"></a><em style="font-style: italic">with something you learn things you can’t learn any other way</em>. You learn that beginnings do not represent complete experiences. The beginnings of juggling, for example, are ineptitude and frustration. You keep dropping the balls and can’t believe you’re ever going to get the hang of it.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">But ineptitude and frustration will pass, and then you’ll start to feel pleasure with acquiring a new skill. Now when you see a master juggler you’ll really appreciate what she’s doing. You’ll begin to admire craft no matter where you see it, in all arts, in all professions.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Sticking with a simple little project for thirty days can make you realize something that could change your life: <em style="font-style: italic">Commitment and mastery do not close doors; they open them</em>. For the first time you will begin to know what high achievers always knew. Making a choice doesn’t lock you into limits, it sets you free to fully develop your gifts.</p>

How do I actually do this thing? I’m the one who runs from commitment, who has trouble learning, who is overcome with heavyheartedness or worry whenever I try to stick to something. What am I supposed to do when the going gets tough?</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Here’s what you’re supposed to do: <em style="font-style: italic">Put one foot in front of the other</em>.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">As soon as you start getting jumpy or distracted, or you start asking yourself “Why am I doing this?” always remember the answer: You’re doing it because you decided to. That’s all, and that’s enough. You don’t need a better reason. This is no time to reevaluate your efforts. Just put one foot in front of another, and do not stop.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">That’s how you stick to a commitment.</p>

<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">Don’t worry. You won’t have to fight them alone. In your push for mastery, you have gained a powerful ally.</p>

<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">What do I mean by nature? I mean the materials you work with. Your materials might be numbers or sounds or words or wood&mdash;or gravity or weather or physics. If you’re working with people, your material is human nature. Whenever you give your focused attention to your work, your materials will guide you.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">What does this mean in actual terms? A very fine cook said to me, “My secret is that I let the food tell me what to do. I don’t plan ahead, I just go to the market to see what’s fresh. I come home and lay everything on the kitchen table and I look at it and try to imagine what it can be. The spices, the timing, the pots and pans are, to a certain extent, beyond my choosing. I have to do what’s needed.”</p>

But without the sculptor the stone will stay forever a block of stone. The two are engaged in a delicate partnership to create a statue.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0.3em; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1em">All good work is a partnership between you and nature, and that partnership will end your feeling of isolation. Nature will help you every step of the way. As any deep-sea diver will tell you, when you are in the sea, you are never alone.</p>
