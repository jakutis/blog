# The Questions

## Who am I?

* What are my strengths?
  * when taking a key decision or key action write down what is expected to happen and review it after 9 to 12 months - this will show your strengths after 3 years
  * focus on strengths
  * work on improving strengths
  * discover where your intellectual arrogance is causing disabling ignorance and overcome it
  * remedy bad habits
  * have good manners
* How do I perform? (may be even more important than the previous question)
  * Am I a reader or a listener?
  * How do I learn? (writing or taking notes or talking or ...)
  * Do I work well with people or am I a loner?
  * In what relationship with the people I work well? (subordinate or commander, coach/mentor or not, ...)
  * Do I perform well under stress, or do I need a highly predictable and structured environment?
  * Do I work best in small organization or a big one?
* What are my values?
  * What kind of person do I want to see in the mirror in the morning?
  * To work in an organization whose value system is unacceptable or incompatible with one's own condemns a person both to frustration and to nonperformance.

## Where should I be and what should I be doing?

* Where do I belong?
  * You belong where the answers to Who am I? align with the place.
  * Adapt environment to yourself - “Yes, I will do that. But this is the way I should be doing it. This is the way it should be structured. This is the way the relationships should be. These are the kind of results you should expect from me, and in this time frame, because this is who I am.”
  * Successful careers are not planned. They develop when people are prepared for opportunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values. Knowing where one belongs can transform an ordinary person—hardworking and competent but otherwise mediocre—into an outstanding performer.
* What should I contribute?
  * What does the situation require?
  * Given answers to Who am I? - how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done?
  * What results have to be achieved to make a difference?
  * How to achieve those results in some concrete time interval?
    * Results should be hard to achieve, but within reach
    * Results should be meaningful
    * Results should be visible and measurable

# The Principles

* Do not try to change yourself or others - work hard to improve the way you perform working with others.
* Be responsible for relationships - know the answer to The Questions applied to the people you are working with and make sure they know the answers about you.
* Have a second career (by full changing or by having a parallel or by entirelly retiring to become a social entrepreneur) - you must begin it long before you enter it.
* Direct your careers as a CEO directs employees - move careers in your life as employees in your organization, move activities of aspects of your life as methods of departments of your organization.
