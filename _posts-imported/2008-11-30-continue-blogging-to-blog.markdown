Wikipedia is only as good as it's source... (Score:3, Insightful)

My British Lit professor was always pushing us to use Wikipedia as a source for papers and content. After reviewing the list of contributors to the areas that he wanted us to read I found that he was a regular contributor. The point he knew the entries that he was taking us too had correct information because he made sure of. I think what the article is saying is the same thing. Rather than knock it down academics, or at least their grad students, should be making an effort to update the entries regarding Theoretical Computer Science so that the information is viewed as hear say.

p.s. i am now experimenting with my Getting Things Organized And Done System: a bunch of separate <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> files for these things (up until this writing): personal (various tasks), software development (theory and practice), artefacts (libs), javascript (language, dhtml, rhino, actionscript), xml (microformats, schemas, rdf) and os (filesystems, desktop managers, drivers, servers, infrastructures)
