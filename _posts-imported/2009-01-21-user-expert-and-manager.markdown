For me, productive ways of spending time is to do two things at the same time: one - intensive for mind and the other - easy for body, or one - easy for mind and the other - intensive for body. The balance between these two variants is necessary to keep this system sustainable.

On a similar note (for me, at least), it is good to always understand the two ends of a stick: the requirements and implementation. When you do something (your body or mind, doesn't matter), there has to be the point (requirement) of your action (implementation).

When you develop something (software, an essay, a chair, etc.), it is optimal to either, if your mind is sufficiently advanced for the scale of the creation, have the entire creation in your mind or, if your mind is not sufficiently advanced for the scale of the creation, have the entire creation documented (all the requirements) on some medium. If you can do neither, it saves time (paradoxically) to spend some time experimenting. Also, because every creation (that is made not in factory) is new, experimentation, at least about some requirements, is needed to make sure the requirement is feasible. Prototype, with real world testing is a perfect situation. But almost everytime you don't have that much time. Therefore, if the situation is not perfect, you should make no expectations about the success of your creation. To sum up, a successful development process is a sequence that consists of a top-down (trying to implement requirements) phase, and then the bottom-up (trying to build a well functioning requirements implementation) phase.

Then there are three roles of a human at any area of interest: a user, an expert and a manager. User does what an expert has created and a manager has approved. Expert does what a worker has asked and manager has approved. Manager actions do not directly relate to the creation, but they are required, they are the glue.

One who does the top-down phase is an expert (does experiments of requirements). One who does the bottom-up phase is a worker (does work of implementation). One who controls these phases is a manager (does management of creation).

But this is all my theory of everything. While doing real-world development, there are always some number of inevitable guesses, that cause some degree of errors. But it is wise to take into account as much information about guesses you make as possible.
