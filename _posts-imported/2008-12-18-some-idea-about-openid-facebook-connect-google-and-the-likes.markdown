Just read an article by David Winer: <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/12/04/soonItWillBeTimeToStartOve.html">
Soon it will be time to start over, again</a>. The simplicity of the idea expressed there inspired me to think about something I would like to become a reality. Imagine an extension for OpenID, that lets some OpenID enabled site to ask for a list of applications that the OpenID owner uses... :)

Or better - a custom OpenID, Facebook Connect, Google Connect -compatible system, that does what it can do, without any of the obstacles by the official standard approval body structure.
