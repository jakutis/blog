# Context

This tuesday, 2012-09-25, the first class from the Seminar for Issues in Applied Mathematics course at Kaunas University Technology took place.
The topic was chosen to be Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Computing and Quantum Information.
In this website of mine I would like to share links to latest news and important information that I or my colleagues find on the internet.

# Videos

To start, here's an accessible and practical video from IBM:
