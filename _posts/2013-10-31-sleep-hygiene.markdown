# Revision 2 (2016-09-17)

During the whole day (between waking up and getting to sleep):

- make sure the room contains no electronics
- do not use the bed for anything
- make sure your bed matress is neither too soft, nor too hard
- make sure the room receives as much sunlight as possible
- receive as much fresh air and sunlight as possible
- set aside 8 hours for purely sleep time
- do not consume caffeine
- do not sleep or nap
- begin your day with only stimulating activities, gradually transform into doing calming activities, and end only with them
- wake up and go to bed at the same time every day (have alarm clocks both for waking up, 06:30 for first "ASAP", and going to bed, 21:30 for first "just before")
- do not avoid planned daytime activities, even if feeling tired
- if working 8 hours in an office, do at least 10 minute break outside (e.g. go buy groceries for lunch)

After wake up:

- wake up
- ASAP #1: get sunlight (e.g. open curtains, go outside)
- ASAP #2: go get a glass of cold water (e.g. from the tap, bottle, well)
- ASAP #3: have at least 10minute exercise
- ASAP #4: have breakfast

Before sleep:

- after 18:00: do not look at any electronic screens (especially the back-litten blue screens, only with the unavoidable exceptions, like journal or porn, but with lowest brightness setting)
- after 18:00: do not take any foods or fluids
- as early as possible: ventilate the room with at most 21 degree Celcius fresh air (e.g. turn on AC, open all windows)
- at least 5 hours before sleep: have at least 10minute exercise
- just before #6: prepare your clothes and other things for tomorrow
- just before #5: write down your thoughts (if not dark yet - with a pen on a paper journal, so that no need for bright ambient light, and if dark - on an iPad with lowest brightness)
- just before #4: go to bed when feeling tired and sleepy
- just before #3: read a physical book that is not stimulating
- just before #2: have a hot bath or shower
- just before #1: make the room as dark as possible (or wear eyemask)
- just before #0: make the room as silent as possible (or wear earplugs)
- just before #-1: get into bed on the back with covers, without a pillow and without clothes, but with warm enough socks
- just before #-2: if not asleep, have sex
- just before #-3: if not asleep after ~20 minutes, do sleep meditation (e.g. deep breathing and listening, or Headspace -> Singles -> On-the-go -> Sleep #2 meditation, or direct the mind to the body, think about how it feels, think through the day from start to finish in 30s, scan the body from bottom to top, all the time switching off the muscles, start counting down from 1000)
- sleep

# Revision 1 (2013-10-31)

This is my personal, unprofessional, work-in-progress review of various laymen literature about improving sleep, the most important activity.

Sleep hygiene is a collection of habits that help you to have a good night's sleep.
Most bodily processes (such as temperature and brain states) are synchronised to this internal 24-hour physiological clock, called "circadian rhythm".
The goal of sleep hygiene is to stabilize the circadian rhythm.

## Requirements

1. Sleep in a bedroom that feels restful (dark, quiet) and comfortable (not too soft and not too hard bed matress softness, a cool air temperature, enough blankets to stay warm) is hygienic.
2. Go to bed, when feeling tired and sleepy.
3. Get enough sleep - sleep until you wake up without an external cause.
4. Have a strict routine - work, exercising, meals, drugs, chores, other activities and sleep.
5. Maximise your time being exposed to sunlight.
6. Make your mind associate bedroom place with sleeping activity.
7. Do not drink liquids before bedtime, otherwise you will wake up during the night to go to toilet.
8. Physically and spiritually relax before bedtime.
9. Do not fall asleep at daytime.
10. Address the causes of sleeping problems, not the symptoms.
11. Exercise every day, first when melatonin secretion stops and second when the greatest cardiovascular efficiency is.

## Advice for requirements implementation

1. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. (4)
2. Invest in a mattress that is neither too hard nor too soft. (1)
3. If you can't control noise (such as barking dogs or loud neighbours), buy a pair of earplugs. (1)
4. Use your bedroom only for sleeping. (6)
5. Do not use sleeping pills. (9, 10)
7. Begin your day with only stimulating activities, gradually transform into doing calming activities, and end only with them. (2, 5, 8)
8. Don't take naps. (9)
9. Do not use an alarm clock. (3)
10. Use heavy curtains, blackout shades or eyemask to block out early morning light and any lights during the night. (1, 3)
11. Do not avoid planned daytime activities, even if feeling tired. (2, 4, 5)
12. If lying awake (for 20 minutes, if not morning), leave bed. If not morning, then do a calming activity in another dark and quiet room. (2, 6)
11. Exercise on the first (before breakfast) and the third (90 minutes after dinner) quarter of every day. (11)
12. If you tend to take your problems to bed, try writing them down—and then putting them aside. (8)
13. Do office breaks in direct sunlight. (5)
14. The first thing to do after getting up - raise curtains to let in the morning sunlight. (5)
15. Don't sleep with pets or children. (1)

## Calming (Boring) activities

1. Consciously relaxing and stretching every part of your body, starting with your toes and working up to your scalp.
2. Thinking of a restful scene.
3. Concentrating on the rhythmic rise and fall of your breathing.
4. Focusing on a mantra (repeating a word or phrase constantly).
5. Eating a light and mild snack with [amino acids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_amino_acid#Recommended_daily_amounts) (especially [tryptophan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan) and [complex carbohydrates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate) (oligosaccarides, polysaccharides).
6. <s>Sitting quietly on the couch with the lights off and a cup of caffeine-free tea.</s>
7. Reading something boring, like a telephone book.
8. <s>Joga.</s>
9. Deep breathing.
10. Listening to a relaxing audio.

## Stimulating (Interesting) activities

1. Working mentally (includes thinking about problems, including sleep).
2. Working physically (exercising).
3. Using stimulant (cigarettes), caffeinated (some teas, coffee, cola, chocolate) and depressant (alcohol) drugs.
4. Looking at the clock.
5. Eating heavy and spicy meals with [fatty acids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_fatty_acid#Food_sources).
6. Watching LCD, CRT, LED, projector and other displays.
7. Reading something interesting, like a good book.
8. Listening to an engaging audio.

## Caffeine-free teas

1. Peppermint.
2. Chamomile.
3. Ginger.
4. Red rooibos.
5. Mint.
6. Lemongrass.
7. Hops.
8. Lemon balm (melissa).

## Final remarks

* Sleepiness is only when your eyelids are drooooping.
* Common sleeping problems (such as insomnia) are often caused by bad sleep hygiene reinforced over years or even decades.
* Sleepiness is associated with a drop in body temperature.
* Doing a two-week course of writing a sleep diary with how the requirements are fullfilled can be useful in getting the right facts about your sleep.
* Carbohydrates are not essential nutrients, because they can by synthesized from amino acids and fatty acids.
* Do not eat [simple carbohydrates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate) (sugar) - monosaccharides, disaccharides - at all.
* Eat more vitamins and dietary minerals.
* Sleep inducers include tryptophan, valerian.
* Tryptophan works by increasing the amount of serotonin, a natural sedative, in the brain.
* Carbohydrates facilitate the entry of tryptophan into the brain.
* Vitamin B6 helps convert tryptophan to serotonin.
* A hormone produced by the brain, melatonin is instrumental in regulating the body’s sleep-wake cycle.
* Light is important for the body to produce melatonin which is a sleep promoting substance.
* Sunlight early in the day is particularly helpful in synchronising your body clock.
* Warm hands and feet are particularly important.
