Over the last year and a half the most interesting topic to me was investing.
This is the entire list of materials that I used or plan to use to understand financial assets, mostly stocks.
For focus on other types of investing (e.g. buying, selling, lending, borrowing non-financial assets or starting, growing companies or nurturing relationships or understanding yourself) look elsewhere.

There is a [Goldman Sachs recommended reading list](http://www.stat.unc.edu/faculty/cji/890-11/Goldman-Sachs-Suggested-Reading-List.pdf) and here is my recommended learning procedure:
- listen to The Intelligent Investor audiobook to verify the interest in investing
- constantly use references, regularly listen to Invest Like the Best podcast and occasionally listen to the other podcasts, read microblogs, blogs and Investing for Dummies series books, watch the videos and search for more to stay excited and open-minded
- then listen to Economics in One Lesson, read If You Can and begin CORE Econ to lay the foundation
- then study The Elements of Investing, Irrational Exuberance, Misbehaving, A Random Walk Down Wallstreet and The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing to understand academic investors
- then study The Education of a Value Investor, The Essays of Warren Buffett, Poor Charlie's Almanack and Business Adventures to understand the management of Berkshire Hathaway
- then read Market Wizards, Principles, Street Smarts and No Bull to understand hedge fund managers
- then read The Most Important Thing, Against the Gods, The Little Book of Valuation, Common Stocks and Common Sense, Good Stocks Cheap, Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits and Other Writings, Security Analysis to understand stocks
- then do it to enjoy it
