# Quantum computing

* [The CIA and Jeff Bezos Bet on Quantum Computing](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/429429/the-cia-and-jeff-bezos-bet-on-quantum-computing/)
* [More Certainty On Uncertainty's Quantum Mechanical Role](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/10/121004121638.htm) - University of Toronto scientists' experiments' results tell that the original Heisenberg Uncertainty principle is less accurate than the measurement-disturbance relationship was computed by Masanao Ozawa. This is bad news for quantum cryptography, because it relies on the principle that measurement causes disturbance.
